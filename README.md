## 🧩 Integration with LLMs

CopyForLLM is specifically designed to work seamlessly with Large Language Models. Here are some examples of how it can enhance your workflow:

### Use Case: Chatbot Development

When developing chatbots, context is key. CopyForLLM allows you to copy entire conversation flows, which can be integrated directly into your LLM training data.

### Use Case: Code Generation

If you are using LLMs for code generation, you can copy existing code snippets along with their structure. This ensures that the generated code is contextually relevant and follows your project conventions.

## 📈 Roadmap

We plan to introduce several new features in the coming months:

- **Enhanced Clipboard Features**: Improved management of copied items.
- **Multi-Project Support**: Copy code across multiple projects with ease.
- **Advanced Context Features**: Smart suggestions based on copied content.

Stay tuned for updates!
